; --- Overriding original data ---

[RenamePatch]
String          = Thanks for patching me!                 ; Let's change the "patching" text.
Color           = (0, 255, 0)                             ; And its color.

[Background]
Color           = (192, 64, 192)                          ; Let's change the background color.

[Cursor]
Object          = Particle1 # Particle2 # Particle3       ; Let's replace stars with trees!

[Particle1@Particle]
Graphic         = Tree Short                              ; Some short ones.
Scale           = 0.15 ~ 0.25                             ; Although a bit bigger than the original stars.

[Particle2@Particle1]
Graphic         = Tree Tall                               ; Some tall ones.

[Particle3@Particle1]
Graphic         = Tree Ugly                               ; And some ugly ones, while we are at it!

[Tree Short]
Pivot           = center

[Tree Tall]
Pivot           = center

[Tree Ugly]
Pivot           = center

[Gem]
Graphic         = Gem Green                               ; Let's change that Gem visual too.

[Key]
Graphic         = Star2                                   ; And the content of the chest.

[Star2@Star]
Pivot           = top left

[Music]
MusicList       = Alpha # FastAlpha # OFF                 ; Let's play a bit with the music playlist.

[Alpha]
Sound           = alpha.ogg                               ; Let's change our alpha music loop to a sound sample.
Music           =                                         ; That removes the loading "hiccup" that was happening everytime we were extracting the stream data from the zip file.

[FastAlpha@Alpha]
Pitch           = 2                                       ; Faster, high pitched, version.

[Boink]
Pitch           = 2.2 ~ 3.0                               ; Same for the "boink" sound.
